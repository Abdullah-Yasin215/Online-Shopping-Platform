**Online Shopping Website — Full-Stack .NET Project**
I developed a fully functional online shopping platform using the .NET Framework, integrating ASP.NET Identity for secure authentication, Entity Framework with MySQL for efficient data handling, and Dependency Injection for clean, scalable architecture. The application is structured around RESTful Web APIs and includes robust cookie and session management to ensure secure and seamless user experiences.
To enhance the system’s responsiveness, I integrated SignalR for real-time communication. This enables the Admin to instantly receive alerts when products run low on stock, view live product updates, and restock items promptly. SignalR is also used on the User side to trigger real-time add-to-cart toasts, improving interactivity and overall user experience.
The platform includes dedicated User and Admin panels.
The Admin Panel provides complete control over the inventory—admins can create, edit, update, and delete products, manage categories, track low-stock items in real time, and view full order details, including order statuses (Pending, Shipped, etc.).
On the User Panel, customers can explore product categories such as jeans, tees, and more, choose audience types (Men, Women, etc.), and apply advanced filters like price range, size, color, and sorting options (e.g., price low-to-high).
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, offering a modern, responsive interface with a professional, user-friendly design. A secure payment integration is included to complete the purchasing workflow from cart to checkout.
